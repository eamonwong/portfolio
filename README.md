Crafted with Python, DjangoChat offers a real-time chat platform facilitated by Django, a high-level Python web framework. It provides users with instantaneous messaging capabilities without the need for page refresh. Developed the application from inception to deployment, including database design, frontend and backend implementation, and performance testing and intuitive user interface with responsive design for seamless interaction across devices. The project was built using Python, Django, AJAX and WebSockets

### Connect 4 with AI
[Github](https://github.com/eamonwong/connect4-with-ai)
Created a traditional Connect 4 game in which the opponent is an Al. The AI is on the maximum difficulty to make the game more engaging and exciting for the user. The project was built using Python and Pygame.

### Internet Speed Test with Python
[Github](https://github.com/eamonwong/Internet-Speed-Test-with-Python)
Developed a Python-based internet speed test tool with a graphical interface, allowing users to measure download and upload speeds in real time. The application saves results with timestamps and visualizes historical data using an interactive graph with dual y-axes for clearer comparison. Built with Tkinter, Matplotlib, and Speedtest-cli, the project combines functional utility with data visualisation to monitor network performance over time.

### Sudoku Game & Solver
[Github](https://github.com/eamonwong/Sudoku-Solver-GUI)
Developed a UI to play the game of Sudoku. Implemented a solver feature that searches for a solution to any solvable game using the backtracking approach. The project was built using Python.

### Python Sorting Algorithm Visualisation:
[Github](https://github.com/eamonwong/Python-Sorting-Algorithm-Visualiser)
Built an interactive Python project to visualise sorting algorithms, allowing users to observe step-by-step processes of Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort in real time. The visualisation includes options to reset the list, toggle between sorting orders, and switch between algorithms, all facilitated through custom keyboard controls. The project was built using Python and Pygame.

### FlaskDiary:
[Github](https://github.com/eamonwong/FlaskDiary)
Developed a secure, user-centric diary application using Flask, enabling users to register, log in, and manage personal diary entries. The application features functionality to create, edit, and delete entries, with all data securely stored per user through session management and password hashing.
