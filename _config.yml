description: I am a dedicated and enthusiastic software developer with a strong foundation in Python, Flask, and Django. My recent experience as a Junior Software Developer at Planck has equipped me with valuable skills in rapid development, debugging, and testing within a dynamic startup environment. I have a proven ability to adapt quickly, collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams, and contribute to the successful delivery of projects.

My freelance work has further honed my technical abilities and problem-solving skills, allowing me to design and implement various projects, such as a content aggregator and an expense tracker. I am passionate about continuous learning, as demonstrated by my completion of Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Computer Science and freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python Certification. These courses have provided me with a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, and Python programming.

In addition to my technical skills, I possess excellent communication and teamwork abilities, which I have used to mentor interns and collaborate with senior developers. My experience in startup environments has taught me the importance of agility and innovation, qualities I am eager to bring to a new role. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to a forward-thinking company like AutoRek and to continue developing my skills in a collaborative and innovative setting.
